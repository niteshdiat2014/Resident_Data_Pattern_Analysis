Recommendation: Use Linux/Unix (Kali Linux/Ubuntu etc.) platform for execution without any issue.

The tool provides the resident data pattern of the drive irrespective of the file system information. 
In thsi work the drive sector are assumed to be categorices/classified as Null, Plain text/readable, and Encoded/Implicit data.
The tool assist in gaining graphical visualization of the saved data pattern in the drive by using unsupervised K-means an DBSCAN clustering approaches.
Here, the number of cluster information in K-means is fixed to 3 where as in DBSAN the eps and min_no_samples can be modiied by the user.
The variation in these parameters can lead to different cluster information accordingly.

Syntax for execution:
First get the drive information using "fdisk -l"

Execute:
python <filename>.py -d /dev/sda -o <directory path for output> -T <in seconds> -N <Number of Samples> -S <Total Number of Sector>
